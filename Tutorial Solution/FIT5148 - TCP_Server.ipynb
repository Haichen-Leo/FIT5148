After both ends of a TCP/IP socket are connected, communication is bi-directional.\n","\n","This sample program is based on the standard library documentation. It selects random lines of text from the array of text and sends it to the client. It starts by creating a TCP/IP socket, then bind() is used to associate the socket with the server address. In this case, the address is localhost, referring to the current server, and the port number is 9999.\n","\n","```\n","# Create a TCP/IP socket\n","sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n","\n","# Bind the socket to the port\n","server_address = ('localhost', 9999)\n","print('Starting up on {} port {}'.format(*server_address))\n","sock.bind(server_address)\n","```\n","Calling listen() puts the socket into server mode, and accept() waits for an incoming connection. The integer argument is the number of connections the system should queue up in the background before rejecting new clients. This example only expects to work with one connection at a time.\n","\n","```\n","# Listen for incoming connections\n","sock.listen(1)\n","```\n","accept() returns an open connection between the server and client, along with the address of the client. The connection is actually a different socket on another port (assigned by the kernel). Data is read from the connection with recv() and transmitted with sendall().\n","\n","When communication with a client is finished, the connection needs to be cleaned up using close(). This example uses a try:finally block to ensure that close() is always called, even in the event of an error.\n","\n","```\n","while True:\n","    # Wait for a connection\n","    print('Waiting for a connection')\n","    connection, client_address = sock.accept()\n","    try:\n","        print('Connection from', client_address)\n","        # Get the random line from lines array\n","        line = lines[random.randrange(6)]\n","        connection.sendall(line.encode())\n","        print (line)\n","        time.sleep(5)\n","    finally:\n","        # Clean up the connection\n","        connection.close()\n","\n","```\n","\n","Let's run this application.
